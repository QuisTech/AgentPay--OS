# AgentPay OS – Hackathon Video Script (5 Minutes)

**Goal:** Demonstrate autonomous AI agents negotiating resources and executing on-chain payments under strict human supervision.

## 🎬 Director Mode Script & Timestamps

This script corresponds exactly to the automated "Director Mode" sequence (`?director=true`).

### 0:00 – 0:45 | The Hook & Problem
*   **0:00** "Welcome to the future of the Agentic Economy."
*   **0:05** "We are entering an era where AI agents perform complex tasks independently."
*   **0:13** "But there is one major barrier: Financial Autonomy."
*   **0:20** "Today, an AI agent cannot open a bank account. They are financially paralyzed."
*   **0:28** "Introducing AgentPay OS. The first Treasury Management System for AI."
*   **0:35** "It allows us to provision wallets, set spending budgets, and execute on-chain payments."

### 0:45 – 1:40 | Treasury & On-Chain Funding
*   **0:45** "Let's look at our fleet."
*   **0:50** "Navigating to Agent Treasury..."
*   **0:52** "Here we have our Alpha Research Unit, Omni Data Source, and GPU Cluster."
*   **1:00** "Right now, the Research Unit is running low on funds."
*   **1:08** "Unlike a simulation, AgentPay OS connects to the real blockchain."
*   **1:13** "Connecting Treasury Master Key..."
*   **1:16** "Now that I'm authenticated, I can fund this agent."
*   **1:21** "Sending 500 MNEE tokens..."
*   **1:25** "This transaction is happening on-chain. MNEE provides stable value transfer."
*   **1:35** "And there it is. The agent is capitalized."

### 1:40 – 3:32 | The Core: Autonomous Simulation
*   **1:40** "Now, let's take the human out of the loop."
*   **1:45** "Entering Simulation Engine..."
*   **1:47** "On the right, the terminal output. On the left, the logic."
*   **1:55** "Activating the swarm."
*   **1:58** "Watch closely. The Researcher realizes it's missing data."
*   **2:08** "It queries the network and finds 'Omni Data Source'."
*   **2:18** "It wants to buy. But first, it must check the Smart Contract Governance."
*   **2:28** "The system validates: Is this within the daily limit?"
*   **2:38** "Passed. Payment executed. 200 MNEE moved instantly."
*   **2:48** "Let's check the economy impact."
*   **2:53** "Back to Dashboard..."
*   **2:55** "See the Real-Time Chart? Balances are shifting live as agents trade."
*   **3:10** "Returning to simulation..."
*   **3:15** "Viewing logs..."
*   **3:17** "The simulation continues autonomously. Compute is being leased now."

### 3:32 – 4:17 | Smart Contract Security
*   **3:32** "How do we trust this?"
*   **3:37** "Opening Smart Contracts..."
*   **3:39** "This is the AgentWallet.sol contract. Every agent uses this."
*   **3:49** "It enforces daily limits that reset every 24 hours."
*   **3:59** "It also checks category whitelists. Storage agents cannot buy Compute."
*   **4:09** "This ensures that even if an agent hallucinates, funds are safe."

### 4:17 – 5:02 | Conclusion
*   **4:17** "The future isn't just about smarter models."
*   **4:22** "Final check..."
*   **4:24** "It's about how those models interact with the economy."
*   **4:34** "AgentPay OS provides the missing financial rails."
*   **4:44** "Agents transact. Humans govern."
*   **4:52** "Built with React, Ethers.js, and MNEE. Thank you."
